# Solog WordPress Theme
http://github.com/mkaz/solog

Solog is a simple theme designed to be great for displaying code

It is already setup to automatically syntax highlight your code.
Using the pre, or code tags, it trys to guess the language but you can give it a hint using

    &lt;pre class="lang-py"&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
