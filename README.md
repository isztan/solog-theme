### Usage

The theme is setup to automatically syntax highlight your code. Just use the `pre`, or `code` tags and it will try to guess the language. You can also give it a hint using:

    <pre class="lang-py">
		  print("hello python!")
    </pre>


See [Prettify documentation](http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/wiki/GettingStarted) for more syntax highlighting information
